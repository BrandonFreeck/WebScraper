# WebScraper

I made this a while back in 2016 to make a list of character objects and their related stats from a World of Warcraft stat tracking site.

Should be updated to just use Blizzard's API itself, instead of using a 3rd party that is getting all the info from the API anyways, but this was good practice for scraping data from the web.

Might convert to something else later, mostly here for posterity.
